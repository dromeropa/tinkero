# mise.spec — polyglot dev-tool/runtime version manager (asdf successor).
#
# This is a BINARY-REPACKAGE spec (like walker.spec / elephant.spec): mise is a
# Rust project but upstream ships a fully self-contained prebuilt release
# tarball for linux-x64, so we wrap that rather than compile from source. That
# gets us dnf tracking (clean install/remove/upgrade) for the omedora repo with
# the least moving parts. A from-source cargo build would be the more idiomatic
# public-COPR form (cf. swayosd.spec); binary-repackage is the fastest correct
# thing for the local repo.
#
# The upstream tarball is a small self-contained tree (bin/mise, a fish vendor
# activation snippet, a man page, LICENSE). We ship the binary, man page, the
# fish vendor_conf.d snippet, and the license; we drop bin/mise.d, which is a
# leaked cargo dep-list build artifact (full of /project/... build paths) of no
# runtime value.

%description
mise (formerly rtx) is a fast, polyglot tool-version manager — a drop-in
replacement for asdf — that also handles environment variables and project task
running. omedora uses it as the developer runtime manager; its shell activation
is wired up per-user.

%prep
# The tarball unpacks to a top-level mise/ directory; -n names it so setup
# cd's into the literal `mise` dir (not the default name-version dir).
%setup -q -n mise

%install
install -D -m 0755 bin/mise %{buildroot}%{_bindir}/mise
# Man page.
install -D -m 0644 man/man1/mise.1 %{buildroot}%{_mandir}/man1/mise.1
# Fish vendor activation snippet (auto-sourced by fish from vendor_conf.d).

%changelog
* Fri Sep 11 2026 omedora <noreply@omedora> - 2026.9.5-1
- Bump to upstream 2026.9.5 (what Arch Omarchy ships as mise-bin). Omarchy
  4.0.3's install/user/mise.sh and migration 1787215483 run
  `mise settings set upgrade.auto_prune false`; that setting arrived in
  2026.8.10 and 2026.6.11 rejects it as unknown, aborting fresh installs and
  every `omedora update` on Fedora.

* Tue Jun 16 2026 omedora <noreply@omedora> - 2026.6.11-1
- Bump to upstream 2026.6.11.

* Thu Jun 04 2026 omedora <noreply@omedora> - 2026.6.0-1
- Bump to upstream 2026.6.0.

* Sat May 30 2026 omedora <noreply@omedora> - 2026.5.16-1
- Initial binary-repackage of upstream mise linux-x64 release.
